DONE
* how do I turn a string into an array? (for #game_setup) (use inumerate module?)



* how do I kill a times. loop without using exit?
* does exit quit the program?
* to play game again, put entire game in a loop? (can't redo setup, however.)
* move setup into a new class GameMaster? GameMaster captures parameters, sets up new games, etc?
* turn guess_correct? into game_over?
